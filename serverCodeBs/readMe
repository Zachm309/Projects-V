known bugs and set up

set up server without an IP just do normal comp and execute and pick a comm port ./server 8080

client you must set to IP of PI on same network and initialize the same port number

BUGS: print statement in client becomes unresponsive and second command given will return blank, all following commands work


for true IP

sudo apt update 
sudo apt install net-tools 

ifconfig

ip addr show

look for inet or wlan0

ie 1inet 96.168.2.86/24 brd  everything after and including the slash ignore and thats your ip
